# [Design Resources](http://designresources.party)

👋 Hi, I’m [@skullface](http://twitter.com/skullface)!

✨ I used to keep this info as a Google Doc to share with my most trusted coworkers and friends, but I thought the info would be better served in the open.

⭐️ These lists and the contents within reflect _my_ opinions. I’m aiming for quantity over quality — only resources I would recommend. Suggestions, issues, and PRs are welcome 💖, but just because a resource exists doesn’t necessarily mean I’d recommend it.
